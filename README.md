Cool (Classroom Object-Oriented Language) Syntax Highlighter for Sublime Text
========================

A basic syntax highlighter for the Cool programming language.

Installation
-----------

The easiest way to install the package is through the [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation). Once you have Package Control installed, type `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` (`Cmd`+`Shift`+`P` on Mac) and select the `Package Control: Install Package` command. Select the `Cool` package and wait for it to install.

Usage
-----

Once the package is installed, there will be a language option for Cool (located in the bottom right corner of the window). Unfortuantely, Cool and Lisp share the `.cl` file extension, so you may find that `.cl` files still default to the Lisp highlighter. To change this to Cool, simply click in the bottom right corner of the window where it says Lisp and select Cool from the dropdown.

Bug Reporting
----

This syntax highlighter is still in development. If you discover an issue with the highlighter, please report it in the [issues](https://github.com/princjef/sublime-cool-highlighter/issues) section of this repository. Feel free to fork and pull request if you would like to fix a bug/add a feature yourself.
